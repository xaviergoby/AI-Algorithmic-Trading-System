    "A time series, TS, is usually broken down into 4 components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Trend component\n",
    "\t- Reflects the long-term progression/behaviour of a TS (secular variation)\n",
    "\t- A trend is present in a TS if there is a persistent increase or decrease occuring in a certain direction\n",
    "\t- Does not need to be linear\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Cyclical component\n",
    "\t- Reflects repeating, non-periodic fluctuations present within a TS\n",
    "\t- \"The duration of these fluctuations is usually of at least two years.\" - Wikipedia, Decomposition of time series\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Seasonal component\n",
    "\t- Reflects the seasonality (seasonal variation) present in a TS\n",
    "\t- A seasonal pattern exists when a time series is influenced by seasonal factors\n",
    "\t- Seasonality occurs over a fixed and known period of time (e.g. the 1/4 of a year, the month or the day of the weeek)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Residual (aka \"noise\"?) component\n",
    "\t- Represents the remains of a TS after all its other components have been removed from it "
